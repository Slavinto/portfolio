# A portfolio project for Slava

## About me

_Hello there, my name is Slava._
I work as an engeneer in rocket space corporation "Energia" in Korolev, Russia.
Couple of years ago I've decided to learn programming and to concentrate on web
development.
I strive to become a full-stack web developer and familiarize myself with - JavaScript - TypeScript - React.js - [Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Next_JS-black?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white&logo=nextdotjs&color=000000) - [Framer](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Framer-black?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white&logo=framer&color=0055FF) - Prisma
and other related technologies.
In this project I'm planning to use some of the features of the above tech stack
that I've learned and maybe some others.
