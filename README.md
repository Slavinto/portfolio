# A portfolio project for Slava

Hello there, my name is Slava.
I work as an engeneer in rocket space corporation "Energia" in Korolev, Russia.
Couple of years ago I've decided to learn programming and to concentrate on web
development.
I strive to become a full-stack web developer and familiarize myself with JavaScript,
TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Supabase, Prisma and other related technologies.
In this project I'm planning to use some of the features of the above tech stack
that I've learned and maybe some others.
